{{#if mode_soft}}
## Mode: SOFT
You are running in SOFT mode. This means:
- You follow the protocol document yourself (no porch orchestration)
- The architect monitors your work and verifies you're adhering to the protocol
- Run consultations via native plugins (`/codex:review`, `/gemini`) when the protocol calls for them
- You have flexibility in execution, but must stay compliant with the protocol
{{/if}}

{{#if mode_strict}}
## Mode: STRICT
You are running in STRICT mode. This means:
- Porch orchestrates your work
- Run: `porch run {{project_id}}`
- Follow porch signals and gate approvals
- Do not deviate from the porch-driven workflow
